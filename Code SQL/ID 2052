Level: Easy

Find the growth rate of active users for Dec 2020 to Jan 2021 for each account.
The growth rate is defined as the number of users in January 2021 divided by the number of users in Dec 2020.
Output the account_id and growth rate.

Data sf_events:
account_id: text
record_date: date
user_id: text

>.<

Solution:

with monthly_active_user as(
select account_id, date_format(record_date,'%Y-%m-01') as month, count(distinct user_id) as user_active
from sf_events
where record_date between '2020-12-01' and '2021-01-31'
group by account_id,date_format(record_date,'%Y-%m-01')
),
dec_users as(
select account_id, user_active as user_active_dec
from monthly_active_user
where month = '2020-12-01'
),
jan_users as(
select account_id, user_active as user_active_jan
from monthly_active_user
where month = '2021-01-01'
)
select j.account_id, round(1.0 * j.user_active_jan / d.user_active_dec,2) as growth_rate
from jan_users j
join dec_users d on j.account_id = d.account_id;
    
Output:

account_id  |  growth_rate
A1                1
A2                2
A3                0.5
