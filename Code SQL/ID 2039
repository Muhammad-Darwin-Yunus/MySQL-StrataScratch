Level: Easy

Find the number of unique transactions and total sales for each of the product categories in 2017.
Output the product categories, number of transactions, and total sales in descending order.
The sales column represents the total cost the customer paid for the product so no additional calculations need to be done on the column.
Only include product categories that have products sold.

data wfm_transactions:
customer_id: bigint
product_id: bigint
sales: bigint
store_id: bigint
transaction_date: date
transaction_id: bigint

data wfm_products:
product_brand: text
product_category: text
product_description: text
product_id: bigint

>.<

Solution:

select p.product_category,count(distinct t.transaction_id) as number_of_transactions,sum(t.sales) as total_sales
from wfm_transactions t
left join wfm_products p on t.product_id = p.product_id
where year(transaction_date) = 2017
group by p.product_category
having sum(t.sales) > 0
    
Output:
