Link: https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10361-peak-online-time?code_type=3
Level: Easy

You are given a dataset from Amazon that tracks and aggregates user activity on their platform in certain time periods. 
For each device type, find the time period with the highest number of active users.
The output should contain 'user_count', 'time_period', and 'device_type', where 'time_period' is a concatenation of 'start_timestamp' and 'end_timestamp', like ; "start_timestamp to end_timestamp".

Data user_activity:
start_timestamp: datetime
end_timestamp: datetime
user_count: int
device_type: varchar
time_difference: float

>.<

Solution:

select user_count,concat(start_timestamp,'to',end_timestamp) as time_period,device_type
from (
Select start_timestamp, end_timestamp, user_count, device_type,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY device_type ORDER BY user_count DESC) AS rn
from user_activity
) ranked_activity
where rn = 1; 

Output:

user_count | time_period                         | device_type
