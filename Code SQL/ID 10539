Title: User Activity Count 
Link: https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10539-user-activity-count?code_type=3
Level: Easy

Count the unique activities for each user, ensuring users with no activities are also included.
The output should show each user's ID and their activity count, with zero for users who have no activities.

Data user_profiles:
user_id: int
name: varchar
email: varchar
signup_date: datetime

Data activity_log:
user_id: int
activity_type: varchar
activity_timestamp: datetime

>.<

Solution:

select up.user_id,count(distinct activity_type) total_activity
from user_profiles up
inner join activity_log al using (user_id)
group by up.user_id;

Output:

user_id|total_activity
  1            2
  2            3
  3            3
  6            2
  7            3
  8            3
  9            4
  10            1
